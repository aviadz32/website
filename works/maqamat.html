        <h2>Maqamat</h2>
        <img src="../images/maqamat.jpg" alt="Maqamat">
        <p class="description">Maqamat (2017), a work made in collaboration with the musician Aviad Zinemanas, was born from a joint passion to reclaim the Arab music of early 20th-century Iraq. Innovative for its time, the forerunners of this musical trend were Jewish musicians, among them internationally acclaimed Ezra Aharon and Yusuf Zaarur. These musicians later immigrated to Israel and left their reputation behind. Recordings and archival materials from the estate of these musicians serve the artists as a starting point to dealing with situations of separation, diaspora and yearnings. Catalog text, ‘When Maqam is reduced to a place’ by Eyal Bizawe, is available here (English / Hebrew).</p>
